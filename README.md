# Week-1
# Predicting Solar Power Output Using Linear Regression

# Overview

This project uses a linear regression model to predict solar power output based on meteorological data. The dataset includes features like temperature, humidity, cloud cover, solar radiation, and wind speed. By building a predictive model, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning in renewable energy forecasting.

# Key Features

Input Features: Environmental data such as temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and solar radiation.
Output: Predicted solar power output (in kW).
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
Graphs and Visualization: Correlation heatmaps, scatter plots for feature analysis, and prediction comparisons.

# Workflow

Data Loading: Load the dataset from a CSV file.
Preprocessing: Prepare data by handling missing values and splitting it into training and testing sets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use graphs to analyze relationships between features and target variables.
Model Training: Train a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
Evaluation: Assess model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
Prediction: Accept user inputs for real-time predictions.

# Installation

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Shreyabhelekar/Week-1.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd Week-1
Install required Python libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Results

The trained model provides accurate solar power predictions, as indicated by low MSE and a high R-squared score. Visualizations, such as actual vs. predicted plots, demonstrate the model's performance.
